## ðŸŽ¯ Project Scope

The scope of this project focuses on building a personalized movie recommendation system using **content-based filtering techniques**. It compares movie metadata such as overviews and genres, helping users discover movies with similar themes and characteristics.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters

In a world of overwhelming content on streaming platforms, this system offers a solution for surfacing relevant, interesting films. For businesses, this improves customer satisfaction, time-on-platform, and user retentionâ€”translating to higher engagement and monetization.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by title.
- **Recommendations**: Top 10 movie suggestions based on the selected movie.
- **Poster Fetching**: Fetches movie posters using The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
- **User Interface**: Built using Streamlit for fast and interactive experience.

---

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Cosine similarity for content filtering.
- **Requests**: API communication for movie posters.

## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brendon-tk/Recommender-System.git
   cd Recommender-System

ðŸ§  Responsible AI Considerations
No personal or sensitive user data is collected or used.

Bias mitigation: Recommendations are based on publicly available metadata rather than user ratings or reviews, minimizing bias.

Designed for explainability and transparency, prioritizing user understanding and trust.

We aim to avoid filter bubbles by exploring diverse movie content.

ðŸš§ What's Next?
Integrate collaborative filtering (based on user ratings).

Add filters for genre, year, and language.

Include user login to offer personalized history-based recommendations.

Improve performance with NLP embeddings (e.g., BERT or Sentence Transformers).

Host on HuggingFace Spaces and include mobile responsiveness.
